# Japan-Flights
This is the final project of my 2021 training course in Web development &amp; integration, developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and AJAX. I worked with an autoloader, classes, namespaces and OOP using the MVC method.
This Website consists in selling flights to Japan. The users can create an account, order articles, confirm or delete a cart, proceed to payment with the Stripe API and make requests (cancelling an order, asking a refund...). The flights can also be reviewed thanks to a star rating and comment system.
Finally, there is an Admin account, to see the list of the customers, the reviews and the articles for sale. The Admin can also delete an account or a review, or modify a chosen article (name, picture, price...).
